  |   and Rime must use their contrasting powers to manipulate heat and     |
  |   cold to overcome obstacles. Through cooperation, they will learn      |
  |   about each other and the fate of their worlds.                        |

  |   Developed with both solo and co-op play in mind, players will         |
  |   discover a touching narrative crafted by acclaimed industry veteran   |
